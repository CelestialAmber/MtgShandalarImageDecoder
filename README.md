# ShandalarImageToolbox
This fork adds the ability to export to png, to open .pic files with embedded palette data and to open .spr files. It also supports decompressing the wvl card image files, but can't convert them yet. (Note: My ported code almost perfectly decompresses it, but still has a few differences, mainly bytes being offset by a few bytes from where they should be)

Original version, and code for wvl and cat file parsing were created by https://github.com/ogamespec
