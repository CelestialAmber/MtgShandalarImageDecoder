# ShandalarImageToolbox
This fork adds the ability to export to png, to open .pic files with embedded palette data and to open .spr files. It also supports viewing the wvl files inside of the cat archive files as hexadecimal, but can't convert the wvl card images yet.

Original version created by https://github.com/ogamespec

# Usage
First load a .tr palette file from the game folder, then load any .pic or .spr file.
