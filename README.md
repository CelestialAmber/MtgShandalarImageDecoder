# ShandalarImageToolbox
This fork adds the ability to export to png, to open .pic files with embedded palette data and to open .spr files. It also supports decompressing the wvl card image files, but can't convert them yet.

Original version, and code for wvl and cat file parsing were created by https://github.com/ogamespec


# Usage
First load a .tr palette file from the game folder, then load any .pic or .spr file.
